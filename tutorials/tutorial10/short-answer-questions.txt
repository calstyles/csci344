Please answer the following two questions:

1. What is a join (just in your own words) and why is it useful?
A join allows us to combine two SQL tables together to see the results
of both joined into one. This can be useful for helping us determine who
likes what post and how we can cater to their tastes more.



2. Consider the structure of the posts table: why would you want to use a foreign key (user_id) to the users table instead of storing the username, first_name, and last_name in the posts table?
It allows us to reference the other tables by using one column (the
user_id) to look at the data and by doing this it can help reduce the 
amount of columns that we would need to have in each SQL table.
